I found the method how to communicate with USB devices on windows at
http://www.blog.kslemb.com/doku.php/en/projects/globx/java_hid .

I didn't like the example code on that site, so I wrote my own version of the
same algorithm. It turned out that I only needed the wrapper for the HID.DLL,
the other libraries used in the algorithm were already present in the
platform.jar provided by JNA.
